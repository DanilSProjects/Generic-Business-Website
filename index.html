                    <p>Your humble innkeeper is Barliman Butterbur, a friendly bartender always happy to help. His assistants, Nob and Bob, are well-trained and very much hospitable. Barliman is...uh...hmm, forgot what I was going to write. One thing drives out another, as they say. Oh well.</p>
                    <p>Ah yes, just remembered something important!  For our hobbit friends from the Shire and beyond, we have special designated rooms that will accomodate you folk better than our standard ones. Just ask and we will provide!</p>
